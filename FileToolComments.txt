File Tool Comments


2023-09-14:  Use case diagram and narratives in the ReadMe, I asked them to change.
2023-09-21: What do you mean by “keyword” in the use case analysis?

Not all use cases have narratives.

Functional flow very close to use cases, but that seems reasonable given your application.
2023-09-28: Why do you have two copies of your architecture diagram? Are they the same? Also there is no module table.
2023-10-04: What is the content in the .idea subdirectory? Is this derived content or source?

Good coding standards but you have an example that violates your standards (source file names must be all lower case).

Good that you continue to refine your architecture understanding.

Have you created empty py files as placeholders? It would have been better to at least put a header comment in each one.

Good that your source structure mirrors your architecture.

Good use of GitHub issues to manage tasks.

2023-10-12: GREAT lab report from last week. You really thought about this, and used the learning to draw conclusions about what your team should do. This is what I’d hoped people would get from the exercise.

No new code development.

2023-10-19:  Very good test plan! (Since your application is graphical, it seems that there are not many ways you could input bad data.)

You’re making good progress on the code as well. Commit comments are quite informative.

Is .so a shared library? If so, it should not be in the repository since it is a derived file, which will change if you modify the source file.
